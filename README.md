How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?  

The advantage of us writing the Python CRUD module was that we were able to re-use it for several assignments. We began by simply writing the Create and Read functions one week, then expanded to add more features
like the Update and Delete functions later. The great thing about the code we wrote is that it is modular. Simply by importing our Python module into other projects, we can re-use these functions and save time. If we 
wanted to, we could use this Python module to perform CRUD operations on any Mongo database as long as the configurations for connection are adjusted.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?  

The strategy we used to approach this project was to plan ahead and schedule designated times to work on areas of the project. For example, we spent two weeks working on the Python CRUD module. One week was 
implementing the Create and Read functions, testing them, and then re-writing until the results were how we wanted. The next week, we had the same approach but with the next two functions for Updating and 
Deleting. Similarly, we spent a week focused on how to create users in the Mongo database and assign roles with permissions such as Reading and Writing to and from the database. The main takeaway here is 
that we must plan where we want to focus our time and have a set goal we need to accomplish in that time. This project was streamlined like many other projects for other courses with new features being added 
each week, letting us compound our knowledge.  
A strategy that I would implement for the future would be to figure out exactly what kind of data the customer needs from the database so that I could formulate the queries as best as I could. Also, having a 
complete dataset without null values would decrease confusion and return better results, though it is not always a realistic expectation when working with data.  

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?  

Computer scientists basically are responsible for driving the creation of new software and systems through technical skill. It is more important than ever that there are computer scientists focusing on how 
to solve problems for people and making work more efficient and (sometimes) easier. For example, AI has been a huge recent breakthrough in the technological front with programs coming out that can answer 
complicated queries for people, create art given a basic prompt, and even help diagnose problems in larger systems such as cars or planes. 
For this type of project that we worked on, having the ability to sift through large amounts of data (like the dataset for the Austin Animal Shelter) could allow more animals to find homes or places in society. 
One of the key focuses of the project was to create preset filters for different types of dogs based on what kind of rescue animal they could be. Someone who is not a computer scientist could look at this 
project and be able to see that they have this option for searching data easily without knowing anything about programming. This is because the work of computer scientists is also to help bring technology to a 
wider audience who has a more basic understanding.
